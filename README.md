# Login form helper widget

This widget adds features to the Mendix 7 login widgets:

* Transform user name to lower or upper case
* Login on enter

Place the login widgets and this widget in the same container. Note that the login widgets can be in nested containers or tables; the widget will find them.

If your login form has multiple buttons in the container, set a class on the login button and enter the value for the login button class. That class does not have to exist in your CSS.
